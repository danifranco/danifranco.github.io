    BiaPy is an open source Python library for building bioimage analysis pipelines, also called workflows. The library provides an easy way to create image processing pipelines that are commonly used in the analysis of biology microscopy images in 2D and 3D. Specifically, BiaPy contains ready-to-use solutions for tasks such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, object detection, image denoising, single image super-resolution, self-supervised learning and image classification. The source code is based on Keras/TensorFlow as the backend. See [docs](https://biapy.readthedocs.io) for more info.

    DCRAB monitors submitted jobs into a scheduler system and creates a real time report based on its execution. The report displays some statistics and charts, such as CPU usage, memory consumed by all the processes, Infiniband statistics etc, which may help to understand the behavior of the job at anytime.
