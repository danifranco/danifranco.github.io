  Hi, my name's Daniel and I work as half-time <mark>HPC System Administrator</mark> at Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC), being part of the management and configuration of the biggest cluster of the Basque Country. The other half of my workday I'm a <mark>PhD Candidate</mark> at the University of the Basque Country, together with the DIPC, advised by Prof. Ignacio Arganda-Carreras and Prof. Arrate Mu√±oz-Barrutia. 
  
  My general research area is in Biomedical image processing and Computer Vision, focused in the design and development of novel Deep Learning solutions for the segmentation of organelles in large Electron microscope images and across microscope types and modalities.
