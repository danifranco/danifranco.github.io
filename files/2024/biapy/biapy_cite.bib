	abstract = {BiaPy is an open-source library and application that streamlines the use of common deep learning approaches for bioimage analysis. Designed to simplify technical complexities, it offers an intuitive interface, zero-code notebooks, and Docker integration, catering to both users and developers. While focused on deep learning workflows for 2D and 3D image data, it enhances performance with multi-GPU capabilities, memory optimization, and scalability for large datasets. Although BiaPy does not encompass all aspects of bioimage analysis, such as visualization and manual annotation tools, it empowers researchers by providing a ready-to-use environment with customizable templates that facilitate sophisticated bioimage analysis workflows.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
